Earthy: Academic-strength NLP
====

Earthy is a library for natural language processing in Python. Earthy is built on the not so latest research, and it is researchware that's very use-able for the industry. It was designed from day one (I guess that's today) to be used in research and somehow we know we can use it for real products. Earthy currently supports English. It's an academic open-source software with a commercial-friendly MIT license.
