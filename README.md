Earthy: Academic-strength NLP
====

Earthy is a library for natural language processing in Python. Earthy is built on the not-so-latest research (for now), and it is researchware that's very use-able for the industry. It was designed from day one (I guess that's today) to be used in research and somehow we know it can be used for real products. Earthy currently supports English (for now). It's an academic open-source software with a commercial-friendly MIT license.
